When working with a Priority Encoder, keep these key points in mind:

1. Concept of Priority
Unlike a standard encoder, a priority encoder gives precedence to the highest-order active input.
If multiple inputs are high (1), the output corresponds to the highest-priority input.

2. Truth Table & Logic Design
Define a truth table that prioritizes the highest-order active bit.
Use Boolean expressions or K-map simplification for logic minimization.

3. Handling Invalid Inputs
If no input is active, the output should be all zeros or generate an error flag.
Ensure proper handling of unexpected cases to avoid incorrect outputs.

4. Implementation in Verilog
Use case, if-else, or priority statements to implement the logic.
Avoid combinational loops that could lead to incorrect behavior.

5. Common Applications
Interrupt controllers (CPU prioritizes the most urgent interrupt).
Data encoders (used in digital systems to compress multiple inputs into fewer bits).
Multiplexer address decoding in complex circuits.

6. Glitches & Timing Considerations
Ensure proper gate delay balancing to prevent glitches in output.
In sequential designs, synchronize the encoder with a clock signal to avoid meta-stability issues.
